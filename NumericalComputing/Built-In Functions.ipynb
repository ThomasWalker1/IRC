There are a few reasons you might choose to use the SciPy versions:\n","* You don't have to spend time writing it yourself\n","* The SciPy version will be well-tested and robust\n","* The Scipy version will work element-wise on arrays of data \n","* The SciPy version will be faster to run than what you could write yourself, particularly when operating on arrays of values\n","\n","Many of the functions in ```scipy.special``` may be applied element-wise to NumPy arrays.\n","\n","There is a lot of variation in the functions available in ```scipy.special```  and it's impossible to cover them all.
