The examples will use the ```line_profiler``` [package](https://pypi.org/project/line-profiler/). Don't worry about the details of the implementation, just read the output which appears to find out how much time was spent on each line. Where possible I have tried to use comparable/optimal implementations in non-NumPy/SciPy Python, although it's possible there are better ways."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XBy0rJdCz_EF"},"source":["## Sequence Creation\n","\n","We can create a few sequences (lists or NumPy arrays) and compare how long it takes for them to be created."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7LWR_83XyF37"},"source":["#Install the line_profiler module\n","!pip install line_profiler\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","#Load the module\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","\n","def sequence_creation(repetitions):\n","  \n","  # Repeat the operations a large number of times to get a good length of time\n","  for i in range(repetitions):\n","    # Non-NumPy zeroes\n","    a = [0]*100000\n","\n","    # Numpy zeroes\n","    a = np.zeros(100000)\n","\n","    # Non-NumPy ascending sequence\n","    a = [i for i in range(100000)]\n","\n","    # NumPy ascending sequence\n","    a = np.arange(100000)\n","\n","%lprun -f sequence_creation sequence_creation(1000)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OAAMEqVg5yLv"},"source":["## Dot Product\n","\n","We can compare the time taken to calculate the dot product of two vectors."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-q458HGx2wsu"},"source":["#Install the line_profiler module\n","!pip install line_profiler\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","#Load the module\n","%load_ext line_profiler\n","\n","def dot_products(repetitions):\n","  \n","  # Create the non-NumPy and NumPy arrays to be used\n","  a = [i for i in range(10000)]\n","  b = np.arange(10000)\n","\n","  # Repeat the operations a large number of times to get a good length of time\n","  for i in range(repetitions):\n","    # Non-NumPy dot product\n","    c = sum(i[0] * i[1] for i in zip(a, a))\n","\n","    # Numpy dot procuct\n","    c = np.dot(b, b)\n","\n","%lprun -f dot_products dot_products(1000)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PSAlIc349bRy"},"source":["## Log Function\n","\n","We can compare the time taken to calculate the logarithm of a single value or an array of values.
