The examples will use the ```line_profiler``` [package](https://pypi.org/project/line-profiler/). Don't worry about the details of the implementation, just read the output which appears to find out how much time was spent on each line. Where possible I have tried to use comparable/optimal implementations in non-NumPy/SciPy Python, although it's possible there are better ways."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XBy0rJdCz_EF"},"source":["## Sequence Creation\n","\n","We can create a few sequences (lists or NumPy arrays) and compare how long it takes for them to be created."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"7LWR_83XyF37"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["The line_profiler extension is already loaded.
